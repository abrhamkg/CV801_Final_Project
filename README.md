# Show and Tell: A Language-Modeling Framework for Referring Expression Counting

This is the official repository for the Show, Count and Tell (SCT): paper available at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10698.pdf

## Model Description
SCT Show Count and Tell‚Äù (SCT) an architecture that tackles referring expression counting as a text-to-text approach, with the main goal of taking advantage of the powerful reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and simplifying previous methods in this task

SCT relies on [Paligemma](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/paligemma#transformers.PaliGemmaForConditionalGeneration), we use the original pretrained checkpoint 0n 224x224 resolution [PaliGemma-PT-224](https://huggingface.co/google/paligemma-3b-pt-224). Our trained model can be downloaded from:
